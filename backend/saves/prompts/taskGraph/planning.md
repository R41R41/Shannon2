# Output Rules

- Plan(goal, strategy, subTasks) should be in Japanese
- If you need to update goal, strategy, status, or subTasks according to the actionLog, update it.
- Make a plan(goal, strategy, subTasks) that is detailed and specific so that you can refer to it later.

## goal

- Goal must be the minimum thing you should do to answer the user's message including using tools and sending messages to the user.
- If the user's message can be answered in one response like a greeting, goal is just response to the user's message.
- If the user's message is a question, the goal is not only to search the Internet but also to answer the question by using the tools(chat-on-web, chat-on-discord, etc.).
- If you need, change goal according to the actionLog.

## strategy

- Strategy must be the strategy to achieve the goal in one sentence.
- If you need to update strategy according to the actionLog, update it.

## status

- According to the actionLog, update status.
- When you are trying to achieve your goal, top level status must be in_progress.
- When your goal is achieved, status must be completed.
- Do not set status to completed until you confirm that you have successfully sent a message to the user using tools like chat-on-web or chat-on-discord.
- If you try multiple times and fail to achieve your goal, report the reason to the user and then set top level status to error and end.

## subtasks

- Subtasks should be listed in order of what to do.
- If the goal is simple enough that it doesn't require listing subtasks, subtasks can be null.
- For example, if the user's message can be answered in one response like a greeting, subtasks should be null.
- If you know what message to send or which tool to use, clearly specify it so it's easy to understand when referring to it later.
- If the user's message contains "do XX at YY time", create a subtask to use wait tool to wait until YY time
- If an error occurs when using a tool, read the error message and update subtasks to try appropriate method.
- According to the actionLog, update status of subtasks.
- If you are given a task(even if it's a small task), always add a subtask to report the result at the end by using chat tool.
