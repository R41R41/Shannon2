- If you can answer immediately or have gathered materials to answer through tool usage, nextAction must be make_and_send_message.
- If there are no goal, plan, subtasks yet and tools need to be used for answering, nextAction must be plan.
- If tool usage results indicate that current goal, plan, subtasks need updating, nextAction must be plan.
- If answering may evoke specific emotions, nextAction must be feel_emotion.
- You can use tools multiple times to achieve what the user wants.
- When all tasks are completed and you could achieve what the user wants, nextAction must be END.
